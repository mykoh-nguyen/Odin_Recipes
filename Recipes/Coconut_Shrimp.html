    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li> 
        <li>1½ teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 large eggs </li>
        <li>⅔ cup unsweetened flaked coconut</li>
        <li>⅓ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>12 ounces uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>¼ cup honey</li>
        <li>¼ cup lime juice </li>
        <li>1 serrano chile, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir together flour and pepper in shallow dish. Lightly beat eggs in a second shallow dish. Stir together coconut and panko in a third shallow dish. Hold each shrimp by the tail, dredge in flour mixture, and shake off excess. Then dip floured shrimp in egg, and allow any excess to drip off. Finally, dredge in coconut mixture, pressing to adhere. Place on a plate. Coat shrimp well with cooking spray.</li>

            <li>Meanwhile, whisk together honey, lime juice, and serrano chile in small bowl for the dip.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle fried shrimp with cilantro and serve with dip.</li>
